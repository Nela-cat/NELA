            <p>Whoa it has been seven months since my last blog post and so many things has happened I can not keep up. I’ve met so many great people, I worked on great projects which I am hoping to share on my website soon. For now this is a sneak peak
                of one of my projects I am currently working on which I can not resist to put up straight away. <br> i’ve changed the name as I can to reveal the name as yet but it’s a cosmetics brand design identity where we create a customised lettering
                for the logo and use some great typography for the packaging. The logo is my favourite, it’s romantic yet minimal and clean, modern and chic. I included a moodboard and few simple mock ups with the logo. I just can’t stop looking at this…I
                love it and I hope you will too. </p>

            Candy, also called sweets or lollies is a confection that features sugar as a principal ingredient. The category, called sugar confectionery, encompasses any sweet confection, including chocolate, chewing gum, and sugar candy. Vegetables, fruit, or nuts
            which have been glazed and coated with sugar are said to be candied.
            <br> Physically, candy is characterized by the use of a significant amount of sugar or sugar substitutes. Unlike a cake or loaf of bread that would be shared among many people, candies are usually made in smaller pieces. However, the definition
            of candy also depends upon how people treat the food. Unlike sweet pas br tries served for a dessert course at the end of a meal, candies are normally eaten casually, often with the fingers, as a snack between meals. Each culture has its own
            ideas of what constitutes candy rather than dessert. The same food may be a candy in one culture and a dessert in another.
